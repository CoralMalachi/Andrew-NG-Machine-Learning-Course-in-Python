# Andrew-NG-Machine-Learning-Course-in-Python
This Repository Contains code implemented by me for the Coursera Machine Learning Course taught by Profressor Andrew NG (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). 

Requirements:

Python:>=3.6

Numpy:>=1.2

Scipy:>=1.0

Matplotlib:Latest Version.

I would recommend installing Anaconda(A Tool which installs a given Python Version and also installs the above mentioned libraries without any hassle.Using Python Via anaconda is highly recommended.

Or you can also use pipenv (https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) which is also a good method to create a virtual env for development.

This course is very good for learning the math behind some common ML algorithms and also gives you a lot of answers for questions which could be asked for you in interviews.

If there is any issue do submit a issue for this repository.
